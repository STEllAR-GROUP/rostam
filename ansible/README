This playbook configures new node for the cluster.

Before running this playbook you must:
	- Add MAC Address and Hostname to /etc/dnsmasq.conf (Needed for PXE_boot)
	- Add Hostname and IP Address to /etc/ansible/hosts (Needed for PXE_boot)
	- Add root Public Key to new host (Done by Kickstart)
	- Add Hostname to /etc/ansible/hosts
	- Add Hostname to /etc/slurm/slurm.conf

Use Ansible for the rest:
	-create file named hosts:
                [compute]
                hostname

                [rostam]
                hostname

                [login]
                hostname

	# Update the new nodes:
	- ansible-playbook -i hosts update_node.yml 

	# if the node is compute node:
	- ansible-playbook -i hosts compute_node.yml
	# if it is loging node:
	- ansible-playbook -i hosts login_node.yml

	# Copy the updated /etc/slurm/slurm.conf across the all nodes:
	ansible rostam -m copy -a "src=/etc/slurm/slurm.conf dest=/etc/slurm/slurm.conf"
